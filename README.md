# 🌳 BST Search Visualizer

An interactive **Binary Search Tree (BST)** visualization project built with Python.
This application allows users to insert values into a BST and visually observe the search traversal step-by-step through an animated output.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🌳 Binary Search Tree implementation
* 🔍 Visual search path highlighting
* 🎥 Animated traversal (GIF generation)
* 🧠 Beginner-friendly educational tool
* 🌐 Interactive Gradio interface
* ⚡ Lightweight and easy to run

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Gradio
* NetworkX
* Matplotlib
* NumPy
* ImageIO
* Pillow (PIL)

---

## 📂 Project Structure

```
bst_search.ipynb   # Main notebook containing BST logic and visualization
README.md          # Project documentation
```

---

## ▶️ How It Works

1. The user enters numbers to build the BST.
2. The tree is constructed using standard BST insertion rules.
3. When a search value is provided:

   * The traversal path is recorded.
   * Each step is visualized on the tree.
   * An animated GIF displays the search process.
